<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F">Anesthesiology is a medical specialty that deals with anesthesia and anesthetics. As stated by the <i>American Society of Anesthesologists (ASA)</i>, anesthesologists are highly trained physicians that care for the well being of a patient before, during and after a surgery is performed. It is possible for an anesthesologist to make a portion of the patients body numb or make them fully unconsciousness. Along with their duties throughout the surgery, you are called to perform tasks outside of the operating room before and after the surgery. </font></p>
